##Use Case

The vCloud connector is used as a cloud auto scaling solution for VMWare. For instance, if there is a health rule violation for the VMWare monitoring extension, then the vCloud connector can be invoked and specific workflow tasks can be triggered. These tasks include launching or terminating VMs based on the health rule.
